h1. Banner Rotator

The *Banner Rotator* extension, as its name implies, enables rotating banners on pages.  Banners can be enabled and disabled for specific pages via the page-edit admin interface.  One banner can be assigned to any number of pages.  Banners are randomly selected based on weights you assign, between 1 and 10 - 1 being least likely, 10 most likely to appear.  Banner rotation is enabled for a page in the "meta" drawer on the page-edit screen.  When not directly associated with a page with banner rotator enabled, banners are inherited from the nearest ancestor page.  Banners work by specifying a background image, with optional foreground image and link.

This extension does not support file uploads, and therefore should be used in concert with an asset management extension if direct file upload access is not available.
